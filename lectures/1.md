## What is meant by AI and Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of AI. AI is the study of how to make computers do things that require intelligence when done by humans. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on how to make computers learn from data.

## How does Machine Learning differ from traditional programming?

Traditional programming is about writing code that tells the computer what to do. Machine learning is about writing code that tells the computer how to learn from data.

## What are some examples of types of problems that ML is suited for?

- Image recognition
- Speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Predicting stock prices
- ...

## What is supervised learning?

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data is labelled. The goal is to learn a function that maps the input to the output. The function is learned from a training set of labelled data.

## What are classification and regression?

Classification is a type of supervised learning where the output is a discrete value. Regression is a type of supervised learning where the output is a continuous value.

## What is a loss function?

A loss function is a function that measures how good a model is. The goal is to minimize the loss function.

## What are features?

Features are the input variables.

## What is the reason we need a separate test set?

The test set is used to evaluate the performance of the model. The test set is not used to train the model. The test set is never seen by the model during training.

## What is enabling the recent growth of AI?

The recent growth of AI is enabled by the availability of large amounts of data and the availability of powerful computers.

## What tools are important for an AI engineer?

- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
- ...
